Issue Description
----------


When Imap Server is called and email_from field is not set with your account.alias but the email is in your email server, Odoo generates the following issue:

**Routing: posting a message without model should be with a parent_id (private mesage).**


[...] **CORRECT SET TAKEN FROM LOG**

author_id: [None]
model: [res.partner]
thread_id: [3407]
alias: [mail.alias(290,)]

[...]


[...] **INCORRECT SET TAKEN FROM LOG**

author_id: [None]
model: [False]
thread_id: [False]
alias: [None]

[...]

Solution
----------

When Imap Server is called for account.alias, and email_from is not set on your email correctly, this module overides email_from with your account.alias for you to receive the email.
